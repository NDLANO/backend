# ARTICLE API 
![CI](https://github.com/NDLANO/article-api/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Usage
Creates, updates and returns an `Article`. Implements Elasticsearch for search within the article database.

To interact with the api, you need valid security credentials; see [Access Tokens usage](https://github.com/NDLANO/auth/blob/master/README.md).
To write data to the api, you need write role access.

It also has as internal import routines for importing data from the old system to this database. There are a number of cleaning and
reporting services pertaining to the import which are only available for internal admin services. 

The application can be configured by specifying several parameters as environment variables. See `src/main/scala/no/ndla/articleapi/ArticleApiProperties.scala` for full list.

## Article format
The endpoint `GET /article-api/v2/articles/<id>` will fetch a json-object containing the article in the selected language.
The article body contained in this json-object consists of a strict subset of permitted HTML tags. It may also contain a special tag, `<ndlaembed>`,
which is used to refer to content located in other APIs (including, but not limited to images, audio, video and H5P).

Some example usages of the embed tag:
* `<ndlaembed data-resource="external" data-url="https://youtu.be/7ZVyNjKSr0M" data-id="0" />` refers content from an external source (data-resource). In this case Youtube.
  `data-url` is the url where the resource can be found, `data-id` is an embed tag-identifier used to identify unique embeds in this article and is located in every embed tag.
* `<ndlaembed data-align="" data-alt="Fyrlykt med hav og horisont" data-caption="" data-resource="image" data-size="fullbredde" data-id="1" data-url="http://image-api-url/image-api/v1/images/179" />`
  refers to an image (`data-resource`) located in the [image API](https://github.com/NDLANO/image-api), along with alignment info (`data-align`), alternative text (`data-alt`),
  image caption (`data-caption`), intended display size in the article (`data-size`), the unique embed tag-identifier (`data-id`) and the url where image metadata can be found (`data-url`).

In order to display the article in its intended form all these embed-tags needs to be parsed and replaced with the content from its respectable source.
The [article converter](https://github.com/NDLANO/article-converter) implements the logic needed to do this.


For a more detailed documentation of the API, please refer to the [API documentation](https://api.ndla.no) (Staging: [API documentation](https://api.staging.ndla.no)).

### Validation of article content

Whenever an article is created or updated a validation of the content itself is performed. This is to ensure that only accepted tags and attributes are
used.
A list of permitted HTML/MathML tags and attributes are specified in the repo [validation](https://github.com/NDLANO/validation) in the files `src/main/resources/html-rules.json` and `src/main/resources/mathml-rules.json`.
The `tags` section defines permitted tags without attributes. The `attributes` section defines tags with a list of permitted attributes.

Extra validation is performed on the `<ndlaembed>` tag: based on the `data-resource` attribute a different set of **required** attributes must also be present.
These rules are defined in `src/main/resources/embed-tag-rules.json` in validation-repo. Should any attribute other than those in the required list be present,
they will be stripped before validation (this step is only performed on `<ndlaembed>` tags).

When an article is fetched with the `GET` API endpoint, the api will add a `data-url` attribute on every `<ndlaembed>` tag which also contains a `data-resource_id` attribute.
A `data-id` attribute is appended to each `<ndlaembed>` tag.

### Resource types for embed tags
The embed tag contains a set of attributes which define what content should be inserted. The list below provides an explaination of each recognized attribute.

#### Required Attributes

* **data-resource** - defines the type of resource that should be inserted (can be image, audio, link to another article, ...). Present in every embed tag
* **data-id** - a unique number identifying the embed tag in an article. Present in every embed tag
* **data-url** - a url linking to the resource to insert. Present in image, audio, h5p, external, and nrk
* **data-path** - a path linking to the resource to insert. Present in h5p
* **data-alt** - alternative text to display if the resource could not be inserted. Present in image
* **data-size** - a hint as to how large the resource should be when presented. Present in image
* **data-align** - a hint as to the alignment of the resource when presented. Can be "left" or "right". Present in image
* **data-player** - a video player identifier used to play videos. Present in brightcove
* **data-message** - a message to be displayed when presented. Present in error
* **data-caption** - a caption to display along with the resource. Present in brightcove and image
* **data-account** - the brightcove account id. Present in brightcove
* **data-videoid** - a video identifier. Present in brightcove
* **data-link-text** - the text to display in a link. Present in concept
* **data-content-id** - the id to the article content to be inserted. Present in content-link and concept
* **data-content-type** - the type of the content-link to be inserted. Internal or external
* **data-nrk-video-id** - an ID to nrk videos. Present in nrk
* **data-resource_id** - an ID to an internal resource to be inserted. Present in image and audio
* **data-type** - specifies inline or block concept embed. Present in concept
* **data-code-format** - specifies format of code-block embed. Present in code-block
* **data-code-content** - specifies content of code-block embed. Present in code-block

#### Optional attributes

Optional attribute groups are defined in the validatin library [here](https://github.com/NDLANO/validation/blob/master/src/main/resources/embed-tag-rules.json).
Every attribute in an attribute group must be specified. Otherwise validation will fail.
The following attribute groups exists:
* `data-open-in`: Can only be used for content embed-tags
* `data-upper-left-x`, `data-upper-left-y`, `data-lower-right-x`, `data-lower-right-y`: Can only be used for image embed-tags
* `data-focal-x`, `data-focal-y`: Can only be used for image embed-tags
* `data-title`: Can only be used for code-block embed-tags. Specifies title of code-block
* `data-display`: Can only be used with file. Used to specify inline display of PDF-files. 

### Other tags with extra attributes
The following tags may contain extra attributes which conveys information about how they should be displayed
* `ol`
  * **data-type** - If present and with the value "letters" the bullets should be letters.
* `aside`
  * **data-type** - Specifies how the aside should be viewed
* `embed` resource=concept
  * **data-type** - Specifies type of concept embed. Either inline or as block
